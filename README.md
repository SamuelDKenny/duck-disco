# 🎲 Shut the Box

A simple C# console game based on the classic dice-and-flap logic puzzle.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- Roll two dice.
- Choose flaps whose sum equals the total rolled.
- Repeat until:
  - ✅ All flaps are closed — you win!
  - ❌ No valid flap combinations remain — game over.

  ## 🔁 Game Loop
The game continues until a win condition is met or no further moves are possible.
