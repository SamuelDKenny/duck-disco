# 🎲 Shut the Box

A simple C# console game based on the classic dice-and-flap logic puzzle.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- Roll two dice.
- Choose flaps whose sum equals the total rolled.
- Repeat until:
  - ✅ All flaps are closed — you win!
  - ❌ No valid flap combinations remain — game over.

  ## 🔁 Game Loop
The game continues until a win condition is met or no further moves are possible.

# 🎲 Towers of Hannoi

mathematical puzzle involving three pegs and a stack of disks of different sizes. 
The goal is simple: move the entire stack from the first peg to another peg.

## 🕹️ How It Works

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- You may only move the top disk from any stack.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
